    "text": "I am Xiaochuan Yang, lecturer in data science at Brunel University London. My research interest lies in Probability Theory and its connection with analysis, statistics, and other disciplines of science and technology such as physics, machine learning, geometric and topological data analysis. Previously I held the position of EPSRC postdoc at the University of Bath (UK), the Luxembourg-Singapore bilateral postdoc position, and visiting assistant professor position at Michigan State University (USA). I wrote my PhD thesis at Université Paris-Est."
